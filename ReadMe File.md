<h1> Assignment Project for Getting and Cleaning Data </h1>

<p> As per the requirements, this repository contains the R code and documentation files for the Johns Hopkins Data Science's track course Getting and Cleaning Data. </p>

<h2> Data Background </h2>

<p> The type of data we are trying to obtain and make tidy is the data obtained from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Gear wearable, wherein an experiment was performed on 30 human volunteers to understand the level of human activity while sitting, standing, laying, walking etc. </p>

<p> The data we obtain is the mean and standard deviation of the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the humans in different types of movements and activities. </p>

<h2> Supporting Documentation </h2>

<p> The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered. </p>

<p> CodeBook.md  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. </p>

<p> run_analysis.R  contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. </p>

<p> The output of the 5th step is called  averages_data.txt , and uploaded in the course project's form. </p>
